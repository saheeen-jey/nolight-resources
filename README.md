About Beavers
Beavers are a large, semi-aquatic rodent that are native to North America and Eurasia. They are known for their ability to construct dams and lodges, which they use for protection and shelter. Beavers play a crucial role in maintaining wetland ecosystems, but they have also been heavily impacted by human activity, particularly through habitat loss and over-harvesting for their fur.

Beaver Habitat
Beavers are found in a variety of aquatic habitats, including rivers, streams, ponds, and lakes. They are particularly well-adapted to wetland environments, where they create their dams and lodges. Beavers also play an important role in shaping the landscape through their dam-building activities, which can create new wetland habitats and alter the course of streams and rivers.

Beaver Behavior
Beavers are primarily nocturnal, and spend most of their time in or around the water. They are herbivores, and feed on a variety of aquatic plants, as well as the bark and twigs of trees. Beavers are also known for their dam-building activities, which they use to create a protected, shallow pond that they can swim and forage in. Beavers are social animals, and live in family groups known as colonies.

Beaver Conservation
Beavers have faced a number of threats in recent years, particularly through habitat loss and over-harvesting for their fur. However, there are a number of conservation efforts underway to protect beaver populations and their habitats. These efforts include habitat restoration, translocation programs, and public education campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of beavers in maintaining healthy wetland ecosystems.
